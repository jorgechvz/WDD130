                <p class="introduce">I am a student of the Telecommunications Engineering and Applied Technology degree. Since I started my journey as a programmer, I have built various applications such as web pages. I like to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser and apps.</p>
                <p class="introduce">Think about the last time you were browsing a web page or using an app. Did you need any instructions to do it? Did everything go smoothly? This is what I do: I make apps and websites that are great and easy to use for everyone without the need for instructions or training. I do this for different varieties of business. Take a look at my portfolio, if you think I'd be a good option send me an email.</p>
