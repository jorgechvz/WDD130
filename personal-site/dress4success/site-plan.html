        Hi, I'm Jorge, I am a student of the Telecommunications Engineering and Applied Technology degree. I have built websites as applications. I am very passionate about improving my coding skills & developing applications & websites. When I discovered web design and programming in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. I specialize in creating websites and apps for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn't have to settle for cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs according to what you want at affordable prices. Very often, your website or application is the first impression that your clients receive, so my mission is to make sure that they get a good impression of your business.
